	<p>Above is an animation that is made during my <a href="https://uwflow.com/course/fine150">FINE 150</a> class. I grouped with a really nice girl called Samantha. The video was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_motion">stop-motion animation</a>. We used around 100 of pictures and compressed it into a 11 seconds video. It was a lot of work but in gerenal a very fun project. </p>
